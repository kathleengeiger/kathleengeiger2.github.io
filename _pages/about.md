I’m a licensed psychotherapist in Waco, Texas. I’ve been Licensed by the Texas State Board of Licensed Professional Counselors since 1990, have been in private practice for close to 25 years, and worked in psychiatric hospitals prior to opening my own office.

I work with children in play therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, and I enjoy working with teenagers and adults in various methods of counseling practice. Working with parents to help resolve behavioral and emotional problems with their children is also major part of my practice.

I also work with diagnosis and treatment of Major Depression, Anxiety, Eating Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorders. I have a sub-specialty in traumatic injury and developmental trauma resolution. My practice consists of individual therapy, group therapy, outpatient intensive 3-day therapies, training workshops, and seminars.

In addition to my graduate school training I am also trained as a Somatic Therapy Practitioner and am trained in [Pia Mellody’s Post Induction Therapy](http://www.healingtraumanetwork.net/About.aspx) and am a “Pia Trained” therapist.  The treatment modality used to treat Borderline Personality Disorder is Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, developed by Marsha Linehan.  These and other details of my work is explained on this website.

This is an exciting era in the world of psychotherapy treatment and I look forward to the ways we continue to work with the brain science and research to treat emotional difficulties and mental disorders.

Certified as a Somatic Experiencing Practictioner [Somatic Psychotherapy](https://traumahealing.org).
